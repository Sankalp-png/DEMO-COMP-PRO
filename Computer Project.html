<dd>Galaxies are vast space systems of stars, dust, gas, dark matter and star clusters. The word <i><b><font face="Ink Free" color=red>'galaxy'</font></b></i> comes from the Greek word <i><font color=darkorange>galaxies</font></i> which means milky. It refers to our own galaxy, the Milky Way. The word was used because are galaxy appears as a foggy or milky band of light.<br><br>

<dt><font size=5 face="Castellar"><b>Stars 🌟⭐</b></font>
<dd>Stars are glowing, spherical objects, full of matter called <b><font face="Papyrus" color=babypink>plasma</font></b>. Plasma is the 4<sup>th</sup> state of matter after <font face="Yu Mincho" color=sapgreen><i>solid, liquid, and gas</i></font>. All stars are made of two gases- <font face="MV Boli" color=blue>hydrogen(H<sub>2</sub>)</font> and <font face="Segoe Script" color=burntsienna>helium(He)</font>. The hydrogen accounts for <b><sub>7</sub><font size=2>5%</font></b>, while the helium makes up <b><sub>2</sub><font size=2>5%</font></b> of the matter of a star. As a star ages, hydrogen slowly converts to helium. Thus an old star will have <font size=5>greater</font> amounts of helium.<br><br>

<dt><font size=5 face="Castellar"><b>Constellations </b></font>
<dd>Stars are rarely ever lonely like the Sun. Stars are formed in dense molecular clouds (called <font face="Lucida Handwriting" color=darkpink>"Nebulas"</font>). Ans this results in two or more stars being formed close together. This is why we often find that many stars appear together i a pattern. They are called <font face="Chiller" size=5 color=amber><b>constellations</b></font>. There are <b>88</b> modern constellations.
